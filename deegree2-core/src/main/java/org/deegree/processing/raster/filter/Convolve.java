/**
 * This class offeres some convenience methods for convolving a data matrix. <br>
 * Convolution filtering is often used to reduce the effects of noise in images or to sharpen the
 * detail in rasters. Convolution filtering is a form of spatial filtering that computes each output
 * sample by multiplying elements of a kernel with the samples surrounding a particular source
 * sample. <br>
 * Convolution filtering operates on a group of input values surrounding a center pixel. The
 * adjoining values provide important information about values trends in the area of the values
 * being processed. <br>
 * Convolution filtering moves across the source raster, cell by cell, placing resulting values into
 * the destination raster. The resulting value of each source cell depends on the group of values
 * surrounding the source cell. Using the cell values of the source cell's neighbors, the
 * convolution process calculates the spatial frequency activity in the area, making it possible to
 * filter the values based on the spatial frequency of the area. <br>
 * Convolution filtering uses a convolve kernel, containing an array of convolution coefficient
 * values, called key elements. The array is not restricted to any particular size, and does not
 * even have to be square. The kernel can be 1 x 1, 3 x 3, 5 x 5, M x N, and so on. A larger kernel
 * size affords a more precise filtering operation by increasing the number of neighboring cells
 * used in the calculation. However, the kernel cannot be bigger in any dimension than the source
 * data. Also, the larger the kernel, the more computations that are required to be performed. For
 * example, given a 640 x 480 raster and a 3 x 3 kernel, the convolve operation requires over five
 * million total multiplications and additions. <br>
 * The convolution filtering operation computes each output sample by multiplying the key elements
 * of the kernel with the samples surrounding a particular source cell. For each destination cell,
 * the kernel is rotated 180 degrees and its key element is placed over the source pixel
 * corresponding with the destination pixel. The key elements are multiplied with the source cell
 * value under them, and the resulting products are summed together to produce the destination
 * sample value. <br>
 * The selection of the weights for the key elements determines the nature of the filtering action,
 * such as high-pass or low-pass. If the values of the key elements are the reciprocal of the number
 * of key elements in the kernel (for example, 1/9 for a 3 x 3 kernel), the result is a conventional
 * low-pass averaging process. If the weights are altered, certain cells in the kernel will have an
 * increased or decreased influence in the average. <br>
