 the complete package is deprecated and will be removed; use org.deegree.portal.catalogueManager instead 

The following classes in package "org.deegree.portal.standard.csw.control" are currently not in use:
    AddToShoopingCart
    DeleteFromShoppingCart
    DisplayMapListener
    DownloadListener
    ShoppingCartListener
    SingleLayerSearchListener
These classes provide the shopping cart functionality, which is (due to shortcommings in the CSW spec) 
currently not supported.
