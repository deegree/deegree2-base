        deegree Web Coverage Service (WCS) is an Open Source implementation of
        the OpenGIS&reg; Web Coverage Service (WCS) Implementation Standard. WCS
        defines a standardized interface and standardized operations to access
        geospatial coverages. A coverage (according to the OpenGISÂ® Abstract
        Specification Topic 6: Schema for coverage geometry and functions) is a
        feature that associates positions within a bounded space to feature
        attribute values (range). A coverage does not necessarily have to be a
        raster data set, but most of deegree users utilize the deegree WCS to
        provide uniform access to raster data like topographic maps and remote
        sensing data (like aerial imagery). Other fields of application include
        provision of digital elevation models (DEM) or groundwater surface data.
        </p>
        <p>
        deegree WCS currently implements WCS versions 1.1.0 and 1.0.0 and has
        been chosen as the Open Geospatial Consortiums (OGC) reference implementation for WCS 1.0.0.
        </p>
        <p>
        deegree WCS provides fast access to even huge amounts of coverage data
        (e.g. state-wide satellite image databases) through an indexed file
        storage mechnisms. Besides the service implementation, deegree WCS
        provides command-line-tools to build index-files, index-databases and a
        pyramidal datastructure as raster tree. It supports nearest neighbor,
        bicubic and bilinear interpolation methods for resampling.
        </p>
        <p>
        deegree WCS is certified to be OGC compliant and offers standardized
        access to coverage data. In conjunction with deegree WMS, which can use
        deegree WCS as local or remote datasource, you can add coverage data to
        your spatial data infrastructure. deegree WMS provides the visualization
        while deegree WCS provides access to coverage data from various
        datasources including TIFF, JPG, GIF, PNG, GeoTIFF, etc.
