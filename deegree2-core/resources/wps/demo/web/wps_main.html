        deegree Web Processing Service (WPS) is an open source implementation of the OpenGIS&reg; Web Processing Service 
        Implementation Specifications. It provides HTTP/SOAP interfaces for performing any operation on geo data in the 
        broadest sense. deegree WPS is a container for user defined processes. Any process that implements an java 
        interface defined by deegree can be registered to the deegree WPS; any one who is able to write some java code 
        can create his own procresses. By default deegree WPS comes with one example process for buffering geometries.

        The OGC WPS specification is available in different versions. deegree 2 implements version 0.4.0 of OGC WPS 
        specification. This limits processes to be performed synchronously. OGC WPS 1.0.0 specification also provides for
        asynchronous process performance. This newer version is already available as part of the deegree 3 implementation;
