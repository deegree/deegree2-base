        deegree Web Perspective View Service (WPVS) is an open source implementation of the draft OpenGIS&reg; Web 
        Perspective View Service Implementation Specifications. It provides a simple HTTP GET interface for requesting 
        3D scenes from one or more distributed geospatial databases and/or data files. A WPVS request defines the 
        geographic datasets (which are more or less equivalent to WMS layers), an area of interest, a position of the 
        viewer and the view direction. The response to this request is one image (returned as JPEG, PNG, etc) containing 
        the rendered view of the requested 3D scene.
        </p>
        <p>
        The benefit of a WPVS is its ability to render complex 3D scenes for extremly large datasets with high 
        performance on a server, while the results can be displayed in any web browser without any additional plugins. 
        The WPVS demo comes with a simple HTML/JSP client that enables you to create and manipulate 3D scene views by 
        clicking onto self explaining control elements.
        </p>
        <p>
        Unfortunately, the WPVS specification never became an official OGC standard. deegree implements the draft 
        version of 1.0.0 implementation specification from 2005-10-20.

        Please note: The deegree3 WPVS implementation is already available which offers a massive performance 
        improvement and even better rendering quality. For details see the <a target="_blank"
