        deegree Web Map Service (deegree WMS) is an open source implementation of the OpenGIS&reg; Web Map Service (WMS)
        Implementation Specifications. It &quot;[...] provides a simple HTTP interface for requesting geo-registered map
        images from one or more distributed geospatial databases. A WMS request defines the geographic layer(s) and area
        of interest to be processed. The response to the request is one or more geo-registered map images (returned as 
        JPEG, PNG, etc) that can be displayed in a browser Application. The interface also supports the ability to 
        specify whether the returned images should be transparent so that layers from multiple servers can be combined 
        or not.&quot; (<a href="http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/wms" target="_blank">OGC WMS standard</a>)
        </p>

        The Web Map Service is one of the most mature service specifications of the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC). It
        is available in different versions, while the version 1.1.1 is still the most widely adopted version. WMS 1.3.0 
        is also known as ISO/DIS 19128 and became relevant within the Infrastructure for Spatial Information in Europe 
        (INSPIRE).
        </p>
        <p>
        deegree WMS offers access to versions 1.1.1 and 1.3.0 as well as to rather outdated specification versions (like 
        WMS 1.1.0) to maintain backward compatibility for some legacy clients. It supports on-the-fly coordinate 
        transformation, interpretation of Styled Layer Descriptor (SLD) files as well as access to standardized 
        datasources like Web Feature Service (WFS), Web Coverage Service (WCS), Sensor Observation Service (SOS), etc.
        </p>
        <p>
        A Web Map Service is only as powerful as the data it can serve. deegree provides access to nearly any kind of 
        spatial data sources, be it raster data (topographic maps, aerial imagery, etc.) or vector data (from simple 
        ESRI&reg; shape files to complex database structures defined in Oracle or PostgreSQL/PostGIS). deegree WMS even 
        provides access to Open Streetmap Data, allowing you to integrate the famous streetmaps into you spatial 
        application without writing a single line of code. This makes deegree WMS first choice to power your mapping 
        portal with a broad variety of data sources. It keeps your application simple, powerful and standards compliant.
        </p>
        <p>
        deegree WMS is Open Source software, industry proven and OGC certified. deegree WMS 1.1.1 as well as deegree 
        WMS 1.3.0 are the official reference implementations of the OGC for Web Map Service specification 
        (<a href="http://cite.opengeospatial.org/reference" target="_blank">OGC reference implementation</a>).
