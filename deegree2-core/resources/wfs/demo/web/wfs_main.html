        deegree Web Feature Service (deegree WFS) is an Open Source
        implementation of the OpenGIS&reg; Web Feature Service (WFS) Implementation
        Specification. WFS defines interfaces for accessing and manipulating
        geographic features using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).
        Typically, a WFS is used to read existing feature instances from a
        service, create new feature instances, update and delete existing
        feature instances (also known as CRUD operations). Furthermore, WFS
        provides means to query features based on spatial and non-spatial
        constraints.
        </p>
        <p>
        From a user's perspective, a WFS serves as a data source for vectorial
        data (e.g. census data, land-use patterns or other spatially distributed
        features). In contrast to traditional Geographic Information Systems
        (GIS), which usually store geographic data in vendor-specific file
        formats, WFS provides a uniform interface to access vector data. Behind
        the scenes, deegree WFS handles access to most common file- and database
        formats for spatial data. Within the spatial domain, most common file
        formats are Oracle Spatial, PostgreSQL/PostGIS, Geography Markup
        Language (GML), ESRI shape file format and generic SQL datastores
        (providing access to virtually any database technology).
        </p>
        <p>
        deegree WFS is a full implementation of the WFS 1.0.0 and 1.1.0
        specifications of the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC), thus providing a
        basic WFS (read-only access), an XLink WFS (basic WFS plus GetGmlObject
        interface) as well as a fully-featured transactional WFS (including
        read-and write access to spatial data).
        </p>
        <p>
        deegree WFS is capable of handling simple as well as complex features
        (i.e. features containing features) and therefore the best choice to
        fuel your spatial data infrastructure with a data access component for
        vector data. Handling complex feature models enable deegree WFS to be
        used in complex application fields like city planning (e.g. using
        XPlanungGML, CityGML, and other complex feature models) and
        environmental information systems.
        </p>
        <p>deegree WFS is certified to be OGC compliant.</p>
