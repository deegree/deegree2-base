This folder contains help pages sorted by language.

The WMC files are configured to use the file "menubartop.jsp". 
This JSP enables language support by using the users LOCALE settings.

If you want to support another language than "en" (default) or "de", 
you need to create a copy of one of the existing language folders 
and start translating the content.
You would also need to adjust the code in menubartop.jsp to activate support for the new language.
